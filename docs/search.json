Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.\n\n\n\nOverview\n\nThe challenge\nScreenshot\nLinks\n\nMy process\n\nBuilt with\nWhat I learned\nContinued development\nUseful resources\n\nAuthor\nAcknowledgments\n\nNote: Delete this note and update the table of contents based on what sections you keep.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers should be able to:\n\nView the optimal layout depending on their device‚Äôs screen size\nSee hover states for interactive elements\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select ‚ÄúTake a Screenshot‚Äù. You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it‚Äôs very long, it might be best to crop it.\nAlternatively, you can use a tool like FireShot to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don‚Äôt need to purchase it.\nThen crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.\nNote: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.\n\n\n\n\nSolution URL: Add solution URL here\nLive Site URL: Add live site URL here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSemantic HTML5 markup\nCSS custom properties\nFlexbox\nCSS Grid\nMobile-first workflow\nReact - JS library\nNext.js - React framework\nStyled Components - For styles\n\nNote: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices\n\n\n\nUse this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.\nTo see how you can add code snippets, see below:\n&lt;h1&gt;Some HTML code I'm proud of&lt;/h1&gt;\n.proud-of-this-css {\n  color: papayawhip;\n}\nconst proudOfThisFunc = () =&gt; {\n  console.log('üéâ')\n}\nIf you want more help with writing markdown, we‚Äôd recommend checking out The Markdown Guide to learn more.\nNote: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.\n\n\n\nUse this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you‚Äôre still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.\nNote: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.\n\n\n\n\nExample resource 1 - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.\nExample resource 2 - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.\n\nNote: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge.
